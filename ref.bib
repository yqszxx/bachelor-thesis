   abstract={互联网已经渗入人类社会的各个方面,极大地推动了社会进步.与此同时,各种形式的网络犯罪、网络窃密等问题频繁发生,给社会和国家安全带来了极大的危害.网络安全已经成为公众和政府高度关注的重大问题.由于互联网的大量功能和网络上的各种应用都是由软件实现的,软件在网络安全的研究与实践中扮演着至关重要的角色.事实上,几乎所有的网络攻击都是利用系统软件或应用软件中存在的安全缺陷实施的.研究新形势下的软件安全问题日益迫切.从恶意软件、软件漏洞和软件安全机制这3个方面综述了国内外研究现状,进而分析软件生态系统面临的全新安全挑战与发展趋势.},

	title = {Cache template attacks: automating attacks on inclusive last-level caches},
	isbn = {9781931971232},
	shorttitle = {Cache template attacks},
	abstract = {Recent work on cache attacks has shown that CPU caches represent a powerful source of information leakage. However, existing attacks require manual identification of vulnerabilities, i.e., data accesses or instruction execution depending on secret information. In this paper, we present Cache Template Attacks. This generic attack technique allows us to profile and exploit cache-based information leakage of any program automatically, without prior knowledge of specific software versions or even specific system information. Cache Template Attacks can be executed online on a remote system without any prior offline computations or measurements. Cache Template Attacks consist of two phases. In the profiling phase, we determine dependencies between the processing of secret information, e.g., specific key inputs or private keys of cryptographic primitives, and specific cache accesses. In the exploitation phase, we derive the secret values based on observed cache accesses. We illustrate the power of the presented approach in several attacks, but also in a useful application for developers. Among the presented attacks is the application of Cache Template Attacks to infer keystrokes and--even more severe--the identification of specific keys on Linux and Windows user interfaces. More specifically, for lowercase only passwords, we can reduce the entropy per character from log2(26) = 4.7 to 1.4 bits on Linux systems. Furthermore, we perform an automated attack on the T-table-based AES implementation of OpenSSL that is as efficient as state-of-the-art manual cache attacks.},

	abstract = {For a few years now, attacks involving I/O controllers have been subject to a growing interest. Unlocking smart phones and game consoles through USB connections, or bypassing authentication through Fire Wire are examples of such attacks. Our study focuses on I/O-based attacks targeting Intel PC-based information systems such as laptop or desktop computers. This paper provides a survey of such attacks and proposes a characterization and a classification of these attacks. Then, an overview of various techniques which mitigate the risks related to I/O attacks are described and their respective limitations are discussed. Finally, several I/O attacks we are currently investigating are presented.},
